# Queue manager administration options
{: #mqoc_admin_qm}

You can administer queue managers through the IBM MQ Web Console, IBM MQ Explorer, or runmqsc from an IBM MQ client.

{:shortdesc}

**Note:** The IBM Web Console is provided 'out of the box' with your queue manager, whereas using the IBM MQ Explorer or IBM MQ client requires further setup.

## Where would you like to begin?
{: #start_mqoc_admin_qm}

**Note: ** Before proceeding with any of the options below, please ensure that you have been granted permissions to access queue managers within your IBM MQ service instance (for instructions, follow the [configuring administrator access for a queue manager](tutorials/tut_mqoc_configure_admin_qm_access.html) guide).
